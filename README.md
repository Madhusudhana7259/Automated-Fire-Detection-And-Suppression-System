### Introduction
The Automated Fire Detection and Suppression System is designed to detect fires using Camera and activate suppression mechanisms to control and extinguish the fire. The system leverages YOLOV8 Architecture for accurate fire detection and integrates with hardware components for real-time response. This project demonstrates a practical application of IoT, machine learning, and automation technologies to enhance fire safety.

### Features
- Real-time fire detection using camera
- Machine learning algorithms for accurate detection
- Automatic activation of fire suppression mechanisms
- Integration with hardware components
- User-friendly interface for monitoring and control

### Installation
To set up this project, you need to have Python and the necessary libraries installed.

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Madhusudhana7259/Automated-Fire-Detection-And-Suppression-System.git
    cd Automated-Fire-Detection-And-Suppression-System
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Set up the hardware components as described in the hardware_setup.md file.

### Usage
After setting up the environment and hardware, you can run the main script to start the fire detection and suppression system:
```bash
python main.py
```
The system will start monitoring for fire incidents and activate the suppression mechanism automatically upon detection.
